Recent studies have shown that groups of multiple rare mutations together can explain a large proportion of the genetic basis for some diseases. Therefore, we propose a new statistical method for analysing a group of mutations in order to test for groupwise association with disease status. We compare the proposed weighted-sum method to alternative methods and show that it is powerful for identifying disease-associated groups of mutations, both on computer-simulated and real data. By using computer simulations, we further show that resequencing a few thousand individuals is sufficient to perform a genome-wide study of all human genes, if the proposed method is used. This study thus demonstrates that resequencing studies can identify important genetic associations, provided that specialised analysis methods, such as the proposed weighted-sum method, are used.</p>

abstract = "Sequencing studies are increasingly being conducted to identify rare variants associated with complex traits. The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies. We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component test, \{SKAT\} can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using \{SKAT\} to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that \{SKAT\} can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests. We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies. "

ABSTRACT={Rapid developments in molecular technology have yielded a large amount of high throughput genetic data to understand the mechanism for complex traits. The increase of genetic variants requires hundreds and thousands of statistical tests to be performed simultaneously in analysis, which poses a challenge to control the overall Type I error rate. Combining p-values from multiple hypothesis testing has shown promise for aggregating effects in high-dimensional genetic data analysis. Several p-value combining methods have been developed and applied to genetic data; see Dai et al. (2012b) for a comprehensive review. However, there is a lack of investigations conducted for dependent genetic data, especially for weighted p-value combining methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are often correlated due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Other genetic data, including variants from next generation sequencing, gene expression levels measured by microarray, protein and DNA methylation data, etc. also contain complex correlation structures. Ignoring correlation structures among genetic variants may lead to severe inflation of Type I error rates for omnibus testing of p-values. In this work, we propose modifications to the Lancaster procedure by taking the correlation structure among p-values into account. The weight function in the Lancaster procedure allows meaningful biological information to be incorporated into the statistical analysis, which can increase the power of the statistical testing and/or remove the bias in the process. Extensive empirical assessments demonstrate that the modified Lancaster procedure largely reduces the Type I error rates due to correlation among p-values, and retains considerable power to detect signals among p-values. We applied our method to reassess published renal transplant data, and identified a novel association between B cell pathways and allograft tolerance.}

abstract = "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies have become a widely used tool for identifying genetic variants that affect gene regulation. In these studies, expression levels are viewed as quantitative traits, and gene expression phenotypes are mapped to particular genomic loci by combining studies of variation in gene expression patterns with genome-wide genotyping. Results from recent eQTL mapping studies have revealed substantial heritable variation in gene expression within and between populations. In many cases, genetic factors that influence gene expression levels can be mapped to proximal (putatively cis) eQTLs and, less often, to distal (putatively trans) eQTLs. Beyond providing great insight into the biology of gene regulation, a combination of eQTL studies with results from traditional linkage or association studies of human disease may help predict a specific regulatory role for polymorphic sites previously associated with disease.

abstract ={Objectives: Neurological damage following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is difficult to objectively evaluate in infants. In adults, serum elevations of astroglial S100B correlate with proven brain injury independent of operative temperature. The deleterious effects of inflammatory cytokines, generated during CPB, on the brain have not been studied in infants using S100B as a marker for cerebral injury. Methods: Twelve neonates, weighing 3.3Â±0.2 kg (total circulatory arrest group (TCA)) and 12 infants weighing 7.0Â±1.0 kg (cardiopulmonary bypass group (CPB)) underwent corrective cardiac surgery for various pathologies. Serial blood samples on induction, at the end of CPB, 30 min, 2 h and 24 h after the administration of protamine, were taken. The resultant plasma was frozen to âˆ’80Â°C and stored for batch analysis. Cytokines were measured using ELISAs and S100B using a luminometric assay. Results: The TCA group were younger and experienced a longer perfusion time than the CPB group (137Â±8 vs. 113Â±7, P=0.04). The mean TCA time was 23Â±4 min. The TCA group had significantly higher levels of IL-6 (P=0.001), IL-8 (P=0.005)and S100B (P=0.002) at 24 h. C5b-9 levels were significantly lower in the TCA group: end of CPB (P=0.001), 30 min (P<0.001), 2 h (P=0.002). There was a weak, but significant correlation between IL-6 levels at the end of CPB and S100B levels 2 h later (r=0.55, P=0.03). Long extubation times were associated with high 24-h S100B levels (r=0.52, P=0.01). Conclusions: (1) The TCA group have prolonged rises of IL-6, IL-8 and S100B. (2) The TCA group generates significantly lower complement. (3) Astroglial injury, seen after surgery, may, in part, be cytokine mediated.},
