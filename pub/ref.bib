abstract = {Ventricular enlargement may be an objective and sensitive measure of neuropathological change associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD), suitable to assess disease progression for multi-centre studies. This study compared (i) ventricular enlargement after six months in subjects with MCI, AD and normal elderly controls (NEC) in a multi-centre study, (ii) volumetric and cognitive changes between Apolipoprotein E genotypes, (iii) ventricular enlargement in subjects who progressed from MCI to AD, and (iv) sample sizes for multi-centre MCI and AD studies based on measures of ventricular enlargement. Three dimensional T1-weighted MRI and cognitive measures were acquired from 504 subjects (NEC n = 152, MCI n = 247 and AD n = 105) participating in the multi-centre Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Cerebral ventricular volume was quantified at baseline and after six months using semi-automated software. For the primary analysis of ventricle and neurocognitive measures, between group differences were evaluated using an analysis of covariance, and repeated measures t-tests were used for within group comparisons. For secondary analyses, all groups were dichotomized for Apolipoprotein E genotype based on the presence of an ε4 polymorphism. In addition, the MCI group was dichotomized into those individuals who progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD, and those subjects that remained stable with MCI after six months. Group differences on neurocognitive and ventricle measures were evaluated by independent t-tests. General sample size calculations were computed for all groups derived from ventricle measurements and neurocognitive scores. The AD group had greater ventricular enlargement compared to both subjects with MCI (P = 0.0004) and NEC (P \&lt; 0.0001), and subjects with MCI had a greater rate of ventricular enlargement compared to NEC (P = 0.0001). MCI subjects that progressed to clinical AD after six months had greater ventricular enlargement than stable MCI subjects (P = 0.0270). Ventricular enlargement was different between Apolipoprotein E genotypes within the AD group (P = 0.010). The number of subjects required to demonstrate a 20\% change in ventricular enlargement was substantially lower than that required to demonstrate a 20\% change in cognitive scores. Ventricular enlargement represents a feasible short-term marker of disease progression in subjects with MCI and subjects with AD for multi-centre studies.{\textcopyright} The Author (2008).

Recent studies have shown that groups of multiple rare mutations together can explain a large proportion of the genetic basis for some diseases. Therefore, we propose a new statistical method for analysing a group of mutations in order to test for groupwise association with disease status. We compare the proposed weighted-sum method to alternative methods and show that it is powerful for identifying disease-associated groups of mutations, both on computer-simulated and real data. By using computer simulations, we further show that resequencing a few thousand individuals is sufficient to perform a genome-wide study of all human genes, if the proposed method is used. This study thus demonstrates that resequencing studies can identify important genetic associations, provided that specialised analysis methods, such as the proposed weighted-sum method, are used.</p>},

Nevertheless, the high-dimensional sequencing data poses a great challenge for statistical analysis. The association analyses based on traditional statistical methods suffer substantial power loss because of the low frequency of genetic variants and the extremely high dimensionality of the data. We developed a Weighted U Sequencing test, referred to as WU-SEQ, for the high-dimensional association analysis of sequencing data. Based on a nonparametric U-statistic, WU-SEQ makes no assumption of the underlying disease model and phenotype distribution, and can be applied to a variety of phenotypes. Through simulation studies and an empirical study, we showed that WU-SEQ outperformed a commonly used sequence kernel association test (SKAT) method when the underlying assumptions were violated (e.g., the phenotype followed a heavy-tailed distribution). Even when the assumptions were satisfied, WU-SEQ still attained comparable performance to SKAT. Finally, we applied WU-SEQ to sequencing data from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), and detected an association between ANGPTL 4 and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

abstract = {Converging evidence suggests that common complex diseases with the same or similar clinical manifestations could have different underlying genetic etiologies. While current research interests have shifted toward uncovering rare variants and structural variations predisposing to human diseases, the impact of heterogeneity in genetic studies of complex diseases has been largely overlooked. Most of the existing statistical methods assume the disease under investigation has a homogeneous genetic effect and could, therefore, have low power if the disease undergoes heterogeneous pathophysiological and etiological processes. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset. The genome-wide analysis of nearly one million genetic markers took 7 hours, identifying heterogeneous effects of two new genes (i.e., CYP3A5 and IKBKB) on nicotine dependence.},

abstract = "Sequencing studies are increasingly being conducted to identify rare variants associated with complex traits. The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies. We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component test, \{SKAT\} can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using \{SKAT\} to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that \{SKAT\} can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests. We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies. "

ABSTRACT={Rapid developments in molecular technology have yielded a large amount of high throughput genetic data to understand the mechanism for complex traits. The increase of genetic variants requires hundreds and thousands of statistical tests to be performed simultaneously in analysis, which poses a challenge to control the overall Type I error rate. Combining p-values from multiple hypothesis testing has shown promise for aggregating effects in high-dimensional genetic data analysis. Several p-value combining methods have been developed and applied to genetic data; see Dai et al. (2012b) for a comprehensive review. However, there is a lack of investigations conducted for dependent genetic data, especially for weighted p-value combining methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are often correlated due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Other genetic data, including variants from next generation sequencing, gene expression levels measured by microarray, protein and DNA methylation data, etc. also contain complex correlation structures. Ignoring correlation structures among genetic variants may lead to severe inflation of Type I error rates for omnibus testing of p-values. In this work, we propose modifications to the Lancaster procedure by taking the correlation structure among p-values into account. The weight function in the Lancaster procedure allows meaningful biological information to be incorporated into the statistical analysis, which can increase the power of the statistical testing and/or remove the bias in the process. Extensive empirical assessments demonstrate that the modified Lancaster procedure largely reduces the Type I error rates due to correlation among p-values, and retains considerable power to detect signals among p-values. We applied our method to reassess published renal transplant data, and identified a novel association between B cell pathways and allograft tolerance.}

The two hidden layers case is proved also by using the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Sprecher theorem and this proof also gives non-trivial realizations. "

abstract="The utility of the back-propagation method in establishing suitable weights in a distributed adaptive network has been demonstrated repeatedly. Unfortunately, in many applications, the number of iterations required before convergence can be large. Modifications to the back-propagation algorithm described by Rumelhart et al. (1986) can greatly accelerate convergence. The modifications consist of three changes:1) instead of updating the network weights after each pattern is presented to the network, the network is updated only after the entire repertoire of patterns to be learned has been presented to the network, at which time the algebraic sums of all the weight changes are applied:2) instead of keeping $\eta$, the ``learning rate'' (i.e., the multiplier on the step size) constant, it is varied dynamically so that the algorithm utilizes a near-optimum $\eta$, as determined by the local optimization topography; and3) the momentum factor $\alpha$ is set to zero when, as signified by a failure of a step to reduce the total error, the information inherent in prior steps is more likely to be misleading than beneficial. Only after the network takes a useful step, i.e., one that reduces the total error, does $\alpha$ again assume a non-zero value. Considering the selection of weights in neural nets as a problem in classical nonlinear optimization theory, the rationale for algorithms seeking only those weights that produce the globally minimum error is reviewed and rejected.",

In these studies, expression levels are viewed as quantitative traits, and gene expression phenotypes are mapped to particular genomic loci by combining studies of variation in gene expression patterns with genome-wide genotyping. Results from recent eQTL mapping studies have revealed substantial heritable variation in gene expression within and between populations. In many cases, genetic factors that influence gene expression levels can be mapped to proximal (putatively cis) eQTLs and, less often, to distal (putatively trans) eQTLs. Beyond providing great insight into the biology of gene regulation, a combination of eQTL studies with results from traditional linkage or association studies of human disease may help predict a specific regulatory role for polymorphic sites previously associated with disease.

abstract ={Objectives: Neurological damage following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is difficult to objectively evaluate in infants. In adults, serum elevations of astroglial S100B correlate with proven brain injury independent of operative temperature. The deleterious effects of inflammatory cytokines, generated during CPB, on the brain have not been studied in infants using S100B as a marker for cerebral injury. Methods: Twelve neonates, weighing 3.3±0.2 kg (total circulatory arrest group (TCA)) and 12 infants weighing 7.0±1.0 kg (cardiopulmonary bypass group (CPB)) underwent corrective cardiac surgery for various pathologies. Serial blood samples on induction, at the end of CPB, 30 min, 2 h and 24 h after the administration of protamine, were taken. The resultant plasma was frozen to −80°C and stored for batch analysis. Cytokines were measured using ELISAs and S100B using a luminometric assay. Results: The TCA group were younger and experienced a longer perfusion time than the CPB group (137±8 vs. 113±7, P=0.04). The mean TCA time was 23±4 min. The TCA group had significantly higher levels of IL-6 (P=0.001), IL-8 (P=0.005)and S100B (P=0.002) at 24 h. C5b-9 levels were significantly lower in the TCA group: end of CPB (P=0.001), 30 min (P<0.001), 2 h (P=0.002). There was a weak, but significant correlation between IL-6 levels at the end of CPB and S100B levels 2 h later (r=0.55, P=0.03). Long extubation times were associated with high 24-h S100B levels (r=0.52, P=0.01). Conclusions: (1) The TCA group have prolonged rises of IL-6, IL-8 and S100B. (2) The TCA group generates significantly lower complement. (3) Astroglial injury, seen after surgery, may, in part, be cytokine mediated.},

abstract = "At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from \{MR\} images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data. "

abstract = "Uptill now, the study of regional gray matter atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been assessed with regions of interest, but this method is time-consuming, observer dependent, and poorly reproducible (especially in terms of cortical regions boundaries) and in addition is not suited to provide a comprehensive assessment of the brain. In this study, we have mapped gray matter density by means of voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted \{MRI\} volume sets in 19 patients with mild \{AD\} and 16 healthy subjects of similar age and gender ratio and report highly significant clusters of gray matter loss with almost symmetrical distribution, affecting mainly and in decreasing order of significance the medial temporal structures, the posterior cingulate gyrus and adjacent precuneus, and the temporoparietal association and perisylvian neocortex, with only little atrophy in the frontal lobe. The findings are discussed in light of previous studies of gray matter atrophy in \{AD\} based either on postmortem or neuroimaging data and in relation to \{PET\} studies of resting glucose consumption. The limitations of the method are also discussed in some detail, especially with respect to the segmentation and spatial normalization procedures as they apply to pathological brains. Some potential applications of voxel-based morphometry in the study of \{AD\} are also mentioned. "

In this prospective study we have used a novel longitudinal voxel-based method to map the progression of \{GM\} loss in \{MCI\} patients over time and compared converters to non-converters. Eighteen amnestic \{MCI\} patients were followed-up for a predefined fixed period of 18 months and conversion was judged according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Each patient underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted volume \{MRI\} scan both at entry in the study and 18 months later. We used an optimal \{VBM\} protocol to compare baseline imaging data of converters to those of non-converters. Moreover, to map \{GM\} loss from baseline to follow-up assessment, we used a modified voxel-based morphometry (VBM) procedure specially designed for longitudinal studies. At the end of the follow-up period, seven patients had converted to probable AD. Areas of lower baseline \{GM\} value in converters mainly included the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and lingual and fusiform gyri. Regions of significant \{GM\} loss over the 18-month follow-up period common to both converters and non-converters included the temporal neocortex, parahippocampal cortex, orbitofrontal and inferior parietal areas, and the left thalamus. However, there was significantly greater \{GM\} loss in converters relative to non-converters in the hippocampal area, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. This accelerated atrophy may result from both neurofibrillary tangles accumulation and parallel pathological processes such as functional alteration in the posterior cingulate. The ability to longitudinally assess \{GM\} changes in \{MCI\} offers new perspectives to better understand the pathological processes underlying \{AD\} and to monitor the effects of treatment on brain structure.

abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test–retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by \{MRI\} instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test–retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was &lt;0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was 0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when \{MRI\} instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials.

Today, no standardized computational tools exist for the analysis of \{LNI\} data and widely used methods are sub-optimal for the types of data encountered in real-life studies. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling, a mature approach well known in the statistics community, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing real-life \{LNI\} data. This article presents the theory behind \{LME\} models, contrasts it with other popular approaches in the context of LNI, and is accompanied with an array of computational tools that will be made freely available through FreeSurfer — a popular Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. Our core contribution is to provide a quantitative empirical evaluation of the performance of \{LME\} and competing alternatives popularly used in prior longitudinal structural \{MRI\} studies, namely repeated measures \{ANOVA\} and the analysis of annualized longitudinal change measures (e.g. atrophy rate). In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness measurements from a public dataset consisting of Alzheimer's patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results suggest that the \{LME\} approach offers superior statistical power in detecting longitudinal group differences. "

For each participant, multiple acquisitions of structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were averaged to yield high-resolution, high-contrast data sets. Cortical thickness was estimated as the distance between the gray/white boundary and the outer cortical surface, resulting in a continuous estimate across the cortical mantle. Global thinning was apparent by middle age. Men and women showed a similar degree of global thinning, and did not differ in mean thickness in the younger or older groups. Age-associated differences were widespread but demonstrated a patchwork of regional atrophy and sparing. Examination of subsets of the data from independent samples produced highly similar age-associated patterns of atrophy, suggesting that the specific anatomic patterns within the maps were reliable. Certain results, including prominent atrophy of prefrontal cortex and relative sparing of temporal and parahippocampal cortex, converged with previous findings. Other results were unexpected, such as the finding of prominent atrophy in frontal cortex near primary motor cortex and calcarine cortex near primary visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that cortical thinning occurs by middle age and spans widespread cortical regions that include primary as well as association cortex.},

A decrease in cerulopasmin could be reflected in decreased cellular metabolic processes such as the electron transport system and a decrease in the ability of the brain to protect itself from oxidative damage. Both decreased metabolic activity and an increase in oxidative insults are known to be associated with the neurological events in Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanism by which these phenomena occur are unknown. These results coupled with previous reports from this laboratory on iron regulatory proteins in the brain suggests one way in which cellular dysfunction and oxidative stress occurs in \{AD\} may be through a loss of ability to maintain a balance of essential metals.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

The identification of the underlying mechanism involved in organ targeting is of major relevance for the pathobiology of this disorder. To this aim, we characterized the repertoire of variable region germline genes of λ LC preferentially targeting the heart and compared it with the repertoire of LC that do not in a case-control study. We found that the repertoires were highly restricted, showing preferential use of the same few germline genes but with a different frequency pattern. A single gene, IGVL1-44, was found associated with a 5-fold increase in the odds of dominant heart involvement (after adjusting for confounders in a multivariable logistic model). These results support an involvement of LC genetics in the determination of organ targeting. Study of the characteristics of IGVL1-44-LC with, and of the minority without, heart involvement might lead to identification of LC/tissue interactions.},

abstract = {A genome-wide association study was carried out in 1020 case subjects with recurrent early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) (onset before age 31) and 1636 control subjects screened to exclude lifetime MDD. Subjects were genotyped with the Affymetrix 6.0 platform. After extensive quality control procedures, 671 424 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 25 068 X chromosome SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 1\% were available for analysis. An additional 1 892 186 HapMap II SNPs were analyzed based on imputed genotypic data. Single-SNP logistic regression trend tests were computed, with correction for ancestry-informative principal component scores. No genome-wide significant evidence for association was observed, assuming that nominal P{\textless}5 × 10−8 approximates a 5\% genome-wide significance threshold. The strongest evidence for association was observed on chromosome 18q22.1 (rs17077540, P=1.83 × 10−7) in a region that has produced some evidence for linkage to bipolar-I or -II disorder in several studies, within an mRNA detected in human brain tissue (BC053410) and approximately 75 kb upstream of DSEL. Comparing these results with those of a meta-analysis of three MDD GWAS data sets reported in a companion article, we note that among the strongest signals observed in the GenRED sample, the meta-analysis provided the greatest support (although not at a genome-wide significant level) for association of MDD to SNPs within SP4, a brain-specific transcription factor. Larger samples will be required to confirm the hypothesis of association between MDD (and particularly the recurrent early-onset subtype) and common SNPs.},

abstract = {Background Because most human stroke victims are elderly, studies of experimental stroke in the aged rather than the young rat model may be optimal for identifying clinically relevant cellular responses, as well for pinpointing beneficial interventions. Methodology/Principal Findings We employed the Affymetrix platform to analyze the whole-gene transcriptome following temporary ligation of the middle cerebral artery in aged and young rats. The correspondence, heat map, and dendrogram analyses independently suggest a differential, age-group-specific behaviour of major gene clusters after stroke. Overall, the pattern of gene expression strongly suggests that the response of the aged rat brain is qualitatively rather than quantitatively different from the young, i.e. the total number of regulated genes is comparable in the two age groups, but the aged rats had great difficulty in mounting a timely response to stroke. Our study indicates that four genes related to neuropathic syndrome, stress, anxiety disorders and depression (Acvr1c, Cort, Htr2b and Pnoc) may have impaired response to stroke in aged rats. New therapeutic options in aged rats may also include Calcrl, Cyp11b1, Prcp, Cebpa, Cfd, Gpnmb, Fcgr2b, Fcgr3a, Tnfrsf26, Adam 17 and Mmp14. An unexpected target is the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A synthase 1 in aged rats, a key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Post-stroke axonal growth was compromised in both age groups. Conclusion/Significance We suggest that a multi-stage, multimodal treatment in aged animals may be more likely to produce positive results. Such a therapeutic approach should be focused on tissue restoration but should also address other aspects of patient post-stroke therapy such as neuropathic syndrome, stress, anxiety disorders, depression, neurotransmission and blood pressure.},

abstract = {Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is believed to be an autoimmune disorder initiated by the ectopic expression of a neuron-specific protein in breast and ovarian tumors. PCD antisera was used previously to identify several cerebellar degeneration-related (cdr) genes encoding putative PCD antigens. We have found that the cdr2 gene, which encodes a cytoplasmic leucine zipper protein of unknown function, is expressed in PCD-associated tumors, whereas other cdr genes are not; thus, cdr2 encodes the PCD tumor antigen. To determine whether the expression pattern of cdr2 is consistent with its proposed role in PCD, we have isolated the mouse homolog and examined both the mRNA and protein distribution in adult tissues. We have found that cdr2 mRNA is expressed in almost all tissues, whereas the protein is expressed only in the brain and testis. Within the brain, both the cdr2 mRNA and immunoreactivity are confined primarily to neurons in the cerebellum and brainstem, the regions most affected in PCD. These results suggest first that the tissue-specific expression of cdr2 is regulated at a post-transcriptional level. Moreover, because the brain and testis are considered to be immune-privileged sites, the expression pattern of cdr2 is compatible with the autoimmune model of PCD pathogenesis.},

Palmitoylation is regulated by the opposing enzymes palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and acyl protein thioesterases, which add and remove palmitate from proteins, respectively. Palmitoylation is particularly important for a number of processes including neuronal development and synaptic activity in the central nervous system. Dysregulated palmitoylation contributes to neuropsychiatric disease. In total six \{PATs\} (HIP14, HIP14L, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC9, ZDHHC12, and ZDHHC15) and one thioesterase (PPT1) have been implicated in Huntington disease (HD), Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and infantile and adult onset forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Currently there is no genetic link between \{PATs\} and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis but palmitoylation of amyloid precursor protein-processing enzyme, γ-secretase, influences β-amyloid generation. Several lines of evidence point to a role for palmitoylation by \{HIP14\} in the pathogenesis of HD; \{HIP14\} is dysfunctional in the presence of the \{HD\} mutation and Hip14-deficient mice develop features of HD. Wildtype huntingtin (the protein mutated in HD) enhances the \{PAT\} activity of \{HIP14\} and mutant \{HTT\} interacts less with HIP14. Therefore, it may be that loss of the positive modulation of \{HIP14\} activity due to reduced interaction with huntingtin is important in the disease mechanism. Preliminary evidence suggests a closely related \{PAT\} to HIP14, HIP14L, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of HD. In order to design rational therapeutic approaches to restore palmitoylation in neuropsychiatric disease, it will be critical to better understand the relationships between \{PATs\} and thioesterases with their regulators and substrates.

A decrease in cerulopasmin could be reflected in decreased cellular metabolic processes such as the electron transport system and a decrease in the ability of the brain to protect itself from oxidative damage. Both decreased metabolic activity and an increase in oxidative insults are known to be associated with the neurological events in Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanism by which these phenomena occur are unknown. These results coupled with previous reports from this laboratory on iron regulatory proteins in the brain suggests one way in which cellular dysfunction and oxidative stress occurs in \{AD\} may be through a loss of ability to maintain a balance of essential metals.

Methodology and Principal Findings: To examine the relationship between structure and function of the brain the cortical thickness based on structural magnetic resonance images and motor cortex excitability assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation were correlated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients as well as in age-matched healthy controls. Motor cortex excitability correlated negatively with cortical thickness on the sensorimotor cortex, the precuneus and the cuneus but the strength of the correlation varied between the study groups. On the sensorimotor cortex the correlation was significant only in MCI subjects. On the precuneus and cuneus the correlation was significant both in AD and MCI subjects. In healthy controls the motor cortex excitability did not correlate with the cortical thickness. Conclusions: In healthy subjects the motor cortex excitability is not dependent on the cortical thickness, whereas in neurodegenerative diseases the cortical thinning is related to weaker cortical excitability, especially on the precuneus and cuneus. However, in AD subjects there seems to be a protective mechanism of hyperexcitability on the sensorimotor cortex counteracting the prominent loss of cortical volume since the motor cortex excitability did not correlate with the cortical thickness. Such protective mechanism was not found on the precuneus or cuneus nor in the MCI subjects. Therefore, our results indicate that the progression of the disease proceeds with different dynamics in the structure and function of neuronal circuits from normal conditions via MCI to AD.},

Compared to the controls, all of these cortical regions were significantly atrophied in AD patients (p, 0.0001). However, the entorhinal cortex was the most severely involved brain region studied, with 40% volume loss, and this region provided the highest discriminative accuracy (92%) in separating patients with AD from healthy control subjects. Importantly, the entorhinal volume loss was evident already in mild AD. In addition, the volume of the entorhinal cortex was not dependent on age, but it did correlate significantly with the severity of the disease.  Because  it  assesses  the  major  site  of  initial  neuropathological  changes in AD, magnetic resonance imaging  volumetric measurement of the entorhinal cortex can offer a tool for distinguishing AD patients even in the very early stages of the disease from healthy aged subjects.},

We found hippocampal volume reductions of 14% for the \{MCI\} and 22% for the \{DAT\} group compared to the \{NL\} group. Utilizing regression analyses and after accounting for gender, head size, age, generalized atrophy (CSF), and other temporal lobe subvolumes, the hippocampal volume separated \{NL\} from \{MCI\} individuals, correctly classifying 74%. For \{NL\} and \{MCI\} groups combined the hippocampal volume was the only temporal lobe subvolume related to delayed recall memory performance. When contrasting \{MCI\} and \{DAT\} individuals, the fusiform gyrus volume uniquely improved the ability of the hippocampal volume to separate \{MCI\} from \{DAT\} individuals from 74 to 80%. Our cross-sectional data suggest that, within the temporal lobe, specific hippocampal volume reductions separated the group at risk for \{DAT\} from the normal group. By the time impairments are sufficient to allow a diagnosis of \{DAT\} to be made, in addition to the medial temporal lobe volume reductions, the lateral temporal lobe is also showing volume reductions, most saliently involving the fusiform gyrus.

Neuronal counts in four columns of cortex were significantly reduced in superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, cingulate gyrus and superior and middle temporal gyri. There was no significant difference in the parietal (Brodmann area 7) or occipital (Brodmann area 17) cortex. Corresponding glial counts per square millimetre show a significant increase in the demented group only in the middle and inferior temporal gyri. Neuronal counts correlated weakly but significantly with plaque counts in the same cortical area in the middle frontal gyrus and the superior and middle temporal gyri.

The link between hyperinsulinaemia and \{AD\} may be insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). This enzyme degrades both insulin and amylin, peptides related to the pathology of type 2 diabetes, along with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a short peptide found in excess in the \{AD\} brain. We review the current evidence, which suggests that hyperinsulinaemia may elevate Aβ through insulin's competition with Aβ for IDE. Genetic studies have also shown that \{IDE\} gene variations are associated with the clinical symptoms of \{AD\} as well as the risk of type 2 diabetes. The deficiency of \{IDE\} can be caused by genetic variation or by the diversion of \{IDE\} from the metabolism of Aβ to the metabolism of insulin. It is intriguing to notice that both hyperinsulinaemia and \{IDE\} gene variations are related to the risk of \{AD\} when the Apolipoprotein \{E4\} (ApoE4) allele, the major risk factor of late-onset AD, is not present. Further studies of the role of \{IDE\} in the pathogenesis of AD, which may uncover potential treatment target, are much needed. "

abstract={One of the central research questions on the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the elucidation of the molecular signatures triggered by the amyloid cascade of pathological events. Next generation sequencing allows the identification of genes involved in disease processes in an unbiased manner. We have combined this technique with the analysis of two AD mouse models. (1) The 5XFAD model develops early plaque formation, intraneuronal Aβ aggregation, neuron loss and behavioral deficits. (2) The Tg4-42 model expresses N-truncated Aβ4-42 and develops neuron loss and behavioral deficits albeit without plaque formation.Our results show that learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tasks in Tg4-42 mice at 12 months of age are similar to the deficits in 5XFAD animals. This suggested that comparative gene expression analysis between the models would allow the dissection of plaque-related and -unrelated disease relevant factors. Using deep sequencing differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified and subsequently verified by qRT-PCR. 19 DEGs were identified in presymptomatic young 5XFAD mice, and none in young Tg4-42 mice. In the aged cohort, 131 DEGs were found in 5XFAD and 56 DEGs in Tg4-42 mice. Many of the DEGs specific to the 5XFAD model belong to neuroinflammatory processes typically associated with plaques. Interestingly, 36 DEGs were identified in both mouse models indicating common disease pathways associated with behavioral deficits and neuron loss. }

abstract ={Objective: To assess whether changes in antemortem MRI brain volume measurements are valid predictors of subsequent Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology.Methods: Thirty-nine subjects, 15 nondemented and 24 with cognitive impairment, were followed until death. Regional postmortem measures of senile plaque (SP) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) severity were examined in relationship to cross-sectional and longitudinal volumetric measurements obtained from antemortem MRI.Results: Total brain volume change over time was related to the accumulation of cortical NFT. The rate of ventricular CSF volume increase was related to both cortical NFT and SP. The last hippocampal volume prior to death was related to hippocampal NFT burden; the rate of hippocampal volume atrophy was not related to hippocampal NFT pathology. These significant relationships continue to exist when all nondemented subjects are excluded from analysis. In subjects with cognitive impairment, the best predictor of cortical NFT and SP is the rate of ventricular volume increase. Excluding subjects with long duration between MRI and death did not appreciably alter results.Conclusions: MRI volumes measured over time are valid biomarkers of pathologic progression of AD across a range of antemortem clinical states. The rate of ventricular volume enlargement can be used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment in future clinical trials that are targeted at NFT and SP pathology.},

abstract ={Objective: To analyze the relationship between marital status and risk of AD or dementia.Methods: This study was carried out from the Personnes Agées QUID (PAQUID) cohort, an epidemiologic study on normal and pathologic aging after age 65 years. The PAQUID cohort began in 1988. Individuals were followed up at 1, 3, and 5 years, with an active detection of dementia. Marital status was divided into four categories: widowed, never married, divorced or separated, and the reference category, married or cohabitant. The longitudinal relationship between marital status and risk of incident AD or dementia was analyzed by a Cox model with delayed entry.Results: Among the 3,675 individuals initially not demented, 2,106 were married or cohabitants, 1,287 were widowers, 179 were never married, and 103 were divorced or separated. Among the 2,881 individuals reevaluated at least once for the risk of dementia during the 5-year follow-up, 190 incident cases of dementia were identified, including 140 with AD. The relative risks (RRs) of dementia (RR = 1.91, p = 0.018) and of AD (RR = 2.68, p < 0.001) were increased for the never-married individuals compared with those who were married or cohabitants. This excess of risk was specifically associated with AD. Adjustment for other risk factors of dementia (education, wine consumption), or for factors reflecting social environment, leisure activities, and depression, did not modify the risk of AD for never-married individuals (RR = 2.31, p = 0.02).Conclusions: We confirmed an association between marital status and AD, with an excess risk observed among never-married individuals. This association may provide clues about the pathogenesis of AD.},
